                With a background in Materials Science and Engineering (B.Sc.) and Nanotechnology (M.Sc.) from KTH Royal Institute of Technology, I have built a strong foundation in materials development, semiconductor fabrication, and hardware/software design. Throughout my career, semiconductors have been the red thread, from research and product development to practical applications in advanced hardware. Over my career which started in engineering, I transition into a business-oriented and customer-facing role, leveraging my technical expertise to drive growth in sales, connect technology with customer needs, and contribute to advancing semiconductor innovation.
